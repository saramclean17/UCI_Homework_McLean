# CitiBike Analysis
My assignment was to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total) and work with a timeframe of my choosing.

## Initial Data Cleaning
I choose the data from the year 2020 for both New York and New Jersey in order to compare and contrast city use of bicycle transportation. 
* Created 2 Jupyter notebook files, separating the data from New Jersey and New York CSVs, then compiling each month of CSV into 1 large CSV for the whole year. I initially identified 2018, 2019 and 2020 in my data cleaning process but in the end focused on 2020 as the data files are extremely large.

## Tableau Set Up
I created a story dashboard for New York and New Jersey. Here are the links:
