# CitiBike Analysis
My assignment was to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total) and work with a timeframe of my choosing.

## Initial Data Cleaning
I choose the data from the year 2020 for both New York and New Jersey in order to compare and contrast city use of bicycle transportation. 
* Created 2 Jupyter notebook files, separating the data from New Jersey and New York CSVs, then compiling each month of CSV into 1 large CSV for the whole year. I initially identified 2018, 2019 and 2020 in my data cleaning process but in the end focused on 2020 as the data files are extremely large.

## Tableau Set Up
I created a story dashboard for New York and New Jersey. Here are the links:
* New York: https://public.tableau.com/profile/sara.mclean#!/vizhome/2020_Citi_Bike_Analysis_Overview_NYC/NYCCitiBik

* New Jersey:https://public.tableau.com/profile/sara.mclean#!/vizhome/2020_Citi_Bike_Analysis_Overview_NewJersey/SarasInsight


## Analysis
My analysis was an overview of the similarities and differences between New Jersey and New York cycling habits during the year 2020. 

## City Analysis of New York:
First, in reviewing the most popular start and stop stations, the top stations appear to be in the lower area of Manhattan. What was somewhat surprising is the area around Central Park wasn't more popular although the Central Park West corner was in the top.
Secondly, peak times were in the afternoon and peak months were late summer and early fall. This makes sense as New York in the late summer and fall is the best time of year there.
And younger riders did make longer trips but in general there wasn't too much of a difference. One factor is most likely younger riders are early adopters of the CitiBike program and its a cheaper mode of transportation than taxis and nicer than other mass transit option available in the city.

## City Analysis of New Jersey:
First, in reviewing the most popular start and stop stations, the top stations appear to be clustered together along the waterfront facing Manhattan. 
Secondly, peak times are similar to NYC with later afternoon and early evenings the most popular times. And inline with NYC, the peak months are late summer and early fall. 
Diving deeper into gender patterns, more males appear to use this transportation but when looking at trip durations for customers, females show longer trip durations, at least with the New Jersey data. This could mean that while males use this as a main mode of transportation for work and recreation, females may focus on CitiBike more for recreation and exercise.
