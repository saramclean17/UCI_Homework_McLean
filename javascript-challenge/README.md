# JavaScript Challenge - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Where is the data from?

The data is provided by UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp.

## What did I do?

### [Automatic Table and Date Search](UFO-level-1)

* Using the UFO dataset provided to write JavaScript code that appends a table to my web page and add new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Used the provided HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### [Multiple Search Categories](UFO-level-2)

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns noted in instructions:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
