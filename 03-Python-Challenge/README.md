## These two Python assignments using CSV files in order to calculate financial health of a company during a time period and election results of a local election. 

PyBank

A script that takes a csv of financial data broken down by month and returns a text file with various analytics such as total profits, highest monthly change negative and positive.

  A Python script was written using Visual Studio Code and Terminal to analyze the requested results along with a text file to showcase the solutions and ensure the script worked.
  
  In reviewing the results over a 5 month period, there is a healthy revenue generated of $38M with a small decrease in revenue on average and it shows the greatest decrease in profits to be $2M, which could be a lot but with revenue generated of $38M, it seems from the data that the company can handle the downswings. What I don't know is the goal revenues and whether budgets were met during this time period so the $38M could be less than what the company had anticipated generating over that time period. 

PyPoll

A script that takes a csv of votes cast for an election and returns a tally of all the votes as well as percentages of the total votes cast and the ultimate winner.
  
  A Python script was written using Visual Studio Code and Terminal to analyze the requested results along with a text file to showcase the solutions and ensure this script also worked.
  
  In reviewing the results of the election poll, it highlights that Khan is the winner of the election. According to the results, over 3M votes were cast so I can assume this may be a city or regional election where Khan won by a landslide with 63% of the votes. One point I wouldn't know from the analysis is whether Khan was the incumbant or if he/she was a new candidate who came in an upset the race.
