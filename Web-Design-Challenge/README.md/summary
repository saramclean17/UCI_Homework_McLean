# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

For this homework I was asked to create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I had created in a past assignment -- specifically, plotting weather data.

In building this dashboard, I had to create individual pages for each plot and a means to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also created a landing page, a page to see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page to view the data used to build them. 

Included in this HTML assignment is a total of 7 HTML pages:
1. Landing Page
2. Comparison Page
3. Cloudiness Page
4. Humidty Page
5. Max Temperature Page
6. Wind Speed Page
