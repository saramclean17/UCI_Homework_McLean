## D3NewsHour

My journalism assignment in my data visualization position for a major metro paper involves analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on me to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

Using D3 techniques I've been learning in class, I created a scatter plot that highlights each state in circles.  I coded this graphic in the app.js file of the homework directory,pulling in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 

The final scatter plot shows the following 3 categories of demographic data:
1. Poverty Percentage
2. Median Household Income
3. Median Age

The scatter plot also shows 3 categories of risk factors:
1. Obesity
2. Smoking
3. Healthcare Access
