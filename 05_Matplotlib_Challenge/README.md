## In this assignment, I am asked to review data from the Pymaceutical's most recent animal study.

As stated in the brief, in this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. As part of the assignment, I was to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Summary of Study Results
Capomulin is the most effective drug in terms of decreasing tumor volume and increasing survival rate. Capomulin outperformed the Infubinol, Ketapril, and the placebo in tumor volume reduction and survival rates.It was the only treatment out of the 4 reported where data showed average tumor size consistently decrease over the 45 day treatment.
