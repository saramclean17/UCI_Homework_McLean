## Employee SQL Homework

The goal of the SQL homework was to analyze employee information through several CSV files using the SQL program.

##Process
The intial part of my process involved creating an ERD using the new software program shown in class called QuickDBD. This allowed me to view the
relationships between each of the CSV files.

The next step was to create my schema.sql which created the requested tables and allowed me to import each of the CSV files. 

The last step was to create my query.sql to answer the eight questions posed.

1.List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
