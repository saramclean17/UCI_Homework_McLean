Observations of VacationPy 
Based on the random data of cities obtained, the following observations can be made:
1. As we move towards equator the temperature gets warmer and moving away from the equator the temperatures get cooler. This falls in line with sound data from global scientific studies on weather patterns.

2. As you move away from the equator towards NORTH (positive latitude) the temperature drops or cools down as compared to the temperature on SOUTH (negative latitude). This is noted as a reflection of the use of Max Temp.

3. The latitude has relatively little to no relationship with cloudiness & wind speed as noted within the limits of the data set.
