Observations of VacationPy 
Based on the random data of cities obtained, the following observations can be made:
1. As we move towards equator the temperature gets warmer and moving away from the equator the temperatures get cooler. This falls in line with sound data from global scientific studies on weather patterns.

2. As you move away from the equator towards NORTH (positive latitude) the temperature drops or cools down as compared to the temperature on SOUTH (negative latitude). This is noted as a reflection of the use of Max Temp.

3. The latitude has relatively little to no relationship with cloudiness & wind speed as noted within the limits of the data set. There are a couple of noted anomalies in the southern hemispher plot outcomes noted below but overall the data shows little to no relationships between latitude vs cloudiness and wind speed.

Maps Outcomes
1. The Latitude vs Temperature Plot shows that the further you move from the equator, the temperature drops.

2. The Latitude vs Cloudiness Plot shows no real pattern between cloudiness and latitude.

3. The Latitude vs Wind Speed Plot shows no real pattern between wind speed and latitude.

4. Northern Hemisphere Plots
    Max Temp vs Latitude Linear Regression Model
      The regression displays a negative correlation.
      In the northern hemisphere, the temperature decreases as you move away from the equator.
    Humidity vs Latitude Linear Regression Model
      The regression map displays no real correlation between humidity and latitude in the northern hemisphere. 
      The humidity data is scattered fairly equally along all latitude points.
    Cloudiness vs Latitude Linear Regression Model
      The regression displays no real correlation between the cloudiness and latitude in the northern hemisphere.
    Wind Speed vs Latitude Linear Regression Model
      The regression displays no real correlation between the wind speed and latitude. 
      Wind speeds are fairly consistent along all latitude data points.
      
5. Southern Hemisphere Plots
    Max Temp vs Latitude Linear Regression Model
      The regression displays a positive correlation.
      In the southern hemisphere, the temperature increases as you get closer to the equator.
    Humidity vs Latitude Linear Regression Model
      The regression displays some correlation between humidity and latitude in the southern hemisphere. 
      The data is scattered fairly equally along all latitude data points but overall humidity increases closer 
      to the equator with the current data sets.
    Cloudiness vs Latitude 
      The regression displays some correlation between cloudiness and latitude in the southern hemisphere with 
      the current data set. The data is scattered fairly equally but does show a positive regression though this 
      may be an anomoly as cloudiness may be due to locations of cities, whether they're near bodies of water or 
      in locales with higher cloudiness rates.
    Wind Speed vs Latitude Linear Regression Model
      The regression shows some correlation between the wind and latitude in the southern hemisphere. 
      The data points are scattered fairly equally over the latitude points but there in an increase in the 
      linear regression model.
