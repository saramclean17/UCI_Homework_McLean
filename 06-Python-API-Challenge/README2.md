## Observations on Data 
As expected, temperature correlates well with the latitude. 
As latitude moves away from equator, temperature also decreases
It seems that there is no correlation between humidity and latitude
Even though there is very little correlation between wind speed and latitude, wind speed tends to be higher near arctic and antarctic
